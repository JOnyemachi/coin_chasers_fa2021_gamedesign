Coin Chaser's Fall 2021 Game Design Project

Starting with the tower defense and the VR grab and throw demo, we intend to create a tower defense game that will be played on a VR headset.

While we currently only support Oculus Quest 2 at the moment, this code may work on other headsets, so please feel free to try it out!

If you encounter any issues, please let us know.

# Tutorials and sample code
Please see the tutorials folder for completed tutorials and sample code for different operations.
Currently the only sample is a VR Grab and Throw demo.

A Tower Defense tutorial will also be posted soon.
